CP Upgrade 5.0 to 5.4 Demo

This demonstration shows how to upgrade Kafka 5.0 to Confluent Server 5.4 without downtime 
by adding new brokers to the same cluster and decomissioning the old ones. 

This demo runs with Kubernetes, but the same procedure can be applied to other deployment options such as Ansible or manual setup.
